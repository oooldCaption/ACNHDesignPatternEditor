# Animal Crossing: New Horizons Design Pattern Editor
An editor for Animal Crossing: New Horizons design patterns.

This software only works with hacked switchs and in combination with [JKSV](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSV/releases) to export your device saves, edit them with this tool and reimport them after that.

you can user https://acpatterns.com/browse 
It's planned however to create an own hombrew app to transfer your savegame directly via USB/Network to the tool and vice versa.

## Features which are already working:
* Loading the savegame and showing all of your design patterns.
* Cloning of design patterns
* Swapping of design patterns
* Deleting design patterns
* Importing a picture (png, gif, jpg, bmp, webp) as design pattern with different color quantization algorithms etc.
* Importing ACNL, ACNH and QR codes.
* Edit patterns with a lot of tools. Editing is happening in 32-bit and can be quantized to your liking.
* Edit pattern supports layering and importing smart objects (images).
* Support for full 24-bit colors. (of course you are still limited to a palette of 15 colors)
* Supports transparency.
* Save your designs as project files (keeping all layers).
* Exporting a picture (as png, gif, jpg, bmp) to share it with others
* Exporting a design as QR code (only legacy designs work)
* Full support for pro designs (including legacy 3DS designs like the horned cap)
* Preview of patterns in 3D.
* Of course saving your savegame.
+ Windows and Mac support. (Linux comes soon)

## Features which are planned:
* Add pattern sharing inside the app
* Create a NRO hombrew to transfer the savegame without manual work required.
